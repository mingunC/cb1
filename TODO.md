# TODO Items

## High Priority (Blocks Deployment)
- [ ] Integrate real email delivery in `app/api/send-selection-email/route.ts` so contractor notifications are actually sent. *(current implementation only logs output)*

## Medium Priority (Should fix soon)
- [ ] Hook up automated email notifications in `app/api/quotes/route.ts` using the shared email service.
- [ ] Add admin notification handling in `app/api/quotes/route.ts` after quote requests are created.

## Low Priority (Nice to have)
- [ ] *(none yet)* Add items here as new nice-to-have TODOs are identified.
